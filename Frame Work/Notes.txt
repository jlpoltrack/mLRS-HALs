Goals:

Keep original rates (50/31/19)
Reduced packet size to enable LI 4/7 (SX128x) or 4/8 (SX126x/SX127x) CR
Packet reduced to 60 bytes from 91
Had to scrap setting specific values for channels on failsafe (use no signal anyways)
For MAVFTP, Rx needs to be dropped 1 baud rate level
FLRC rate increased to 143 Hz

Edits:

Updated Common_Conf.h
Updated Frame_Types.h
Updated frames.h
Updated mavlink_interface_rx.h
